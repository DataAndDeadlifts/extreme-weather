# A few statements

As a millenial I'm concerned about climate change...

As a husband I want to protect my family...

As a chronic planner, I want to know where extreme weather events are bad quantify how much worse they are getting.

So, this project is driven by a simple question - "Where in the US will my family experience the least amount of pain stemming from climate events?" 

## Aims

There is a [major dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp) available from NOAA that tracks extreme weather events in the states. We'll be using that to understand the historical information about extreme events and combine that with the conclusions from the recent IPCC report to speculate on where we might stand the best chance of living a peaceful life. Whatever that means in the age of major climate warming...
